# Clarification: LIS 500 Final Project

## `contact.php`

The email sending service is NOT available if the PHP server is run locally on windows, but it is working on Mac OS.

**Note** that all php files in this project are designed to run on `localhost:4040`. To test the code, please enter in the terminal:
`php -S localhost: 4040`
