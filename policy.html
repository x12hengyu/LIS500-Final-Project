                        Members of the group should be open to communication. Members are expected to discuss any ideas, issues, and 
                        questions that are related to our group project to everyone in this group. Private communication is discouraged 
                        during the meeting. We encourage a more united group.

                        When we encounter a problem we should collaborate and reach a consensus. The group's consensus should be the final choice, 
                        not an individual idea.

                        Members are expected to respect the preferences and ideas of others. When there is a different point of view, listen carefully 
                        to understand the other person's ideas. Do not use excessive language to offend the other person. Share your own understanding 
                        after you understand each other's ideas and discuss the consensus together.
